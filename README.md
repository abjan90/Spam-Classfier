The codes and the Solution to the exercises from the book hands On machine learning

1. Stemming bhaneko chahi different word which gives off same meaning lai chahi process garnu bhanda aghi same banauney. So , for eg => if we have word DO , DOING , DOES this have same meaning but if we don't use stemming the model will differentiate each word as different. So we use a natural language processing model called nltk and stem it.

2. We will also need a way to replace URLs with the word "URL". SO we use urlextract library.
